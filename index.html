          <p>Airports are not just transportation hubs; they are critical points of entry and exit that play a major role in a country?s national security. With thousands of people and goods moving across borders daily, airports act as the first line of defense against threats such as terrorism, smuggling, illegal immigration, and cyberattacks.

Modern airports are equipped with advanced surveillance systems, biometric identification, baggage scanning, and armed security personnel to detect and prevent any suspicious activity. These measures are essential to protect the nation from both external and internal threats.

Airports also support the work of immigration, customs, intelligence, and security agencies, ensuring that anyone entering or leaving the country is thoroughly verified. In times of emergency, such as war, natural disasters, or pandemics, airports become strategic locations for military operations, evacuations, and relief efforts.

With the rise in cybersecurity threats, airport management systems, passenger data, and airline operations must also be protected from digital attacks, which could disrupt national stability.

In summary, the role of airports goes far beyond travel and tourism. </p>
